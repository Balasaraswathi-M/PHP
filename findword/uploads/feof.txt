HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language used to create and structure web pages. It's a fundamental building block of the web, and is used alongside CSS and JavaScript to create websites. 
An HTML document starts with <!DOCTYPE html>, followed by <html>, <head>, and <body>. The <head> contains metadata, and the <body> holds the main content.
HTML is the backbone of web development. When combined with CSS and JavaScript, it creates interactive and visually appealing websites.
